# UVP builder's API

Backend implementation for the [UVP builder tool](https://github.com/manfredt27/uvp-builder-web).

**This tool is powered by [Pernix-Labs](http://labs.pernix-solutions.com/)**.

### Setup

Before start the project setup, you need to be sure you already have installed, [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM is enabled on your NodeJS configuration.

It's very important that you have installed [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) and your database server is running.

After that you're ready to go cloning the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/emmurillo/uvp-builder-api.git
```

or vÃ­a SHH if you want.

Now you have to access package.json file, it's located at uvp-builder-api/ folder. Once you're there just install all the dependencies.

```
cd uvp-builder-api
npm install
```

The code tasks is automatized using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) so now you just have to run the setup/server task.

```
gulp
```

### Populate the DB

To automatically fill the Database, this app uses [Mongo seeds](https://github.com/toymachiner62/node-mongo-seeds).
It's necessary install it globally by running

```
npm install -g node-mongo-seeds
```

And finally run the fill task: `seed`

### Add language support

The app allows you to add new languages to the DB and retrieve them from the API.

#### Adding the model

It's as easy as add the JSON file into the `seeds` folder and run the `seed` task.

> Note: 
- The JSON's name will be the DB collection's name too.
Example: methods.json will turn in a methods collection on the DB.
- Be careful when running `seed` as it replaces the whole collection.

### Adding the API

To add the language support to the API create a new module with the language name into methods and copy-paste
any previous valid method scripts.
Rename the API URLs with your language and finally rename the model with your collection/json name.
